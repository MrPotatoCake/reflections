Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
	your world local?
A:  If you wanted to collaborate your code with other users and team up with
	other people, even if they lived a hundred miles away from you, you can
	still work together.

Q: 	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
	automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:	Git needs Internet access to pull files, so if it always did it
	automatically we'd end up getting used to not doing it ourselves, and then
	some day commit something without Internet and the project not making it
	through.

Q:	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
	you use one instead of the other?
A:	A fork is a copy on of someone else's project on GitHub on your own
	profile. A clone is a copy of a GitHub project or a project on your local
	repository which isn't saved on your GitHub account, but rather on your
	system. A branch is when a project breaks off in a different direction
	and gets seperate commits from the rest of the project and has nothing to
	do with GitHub. You use a fork when you want to make some edits to an
	existing GitHub project easily. You use clone normally to make bigger
	edits to a GitHub project, and you would use branches if you wanted to
	experiment different things in your project like different languages
	and difficulties, etc.
