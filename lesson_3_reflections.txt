Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
	your world local?
A:  If you wanted to collaborate your code with other users and team up with
	other people, even if they lived a hundred miles away from you, you can
	still work together.

Q: 	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
	automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:	Git needs Internet access to pull files, so if it always did it
	automatically we'd end up getting used to not doing it ourselves, and then
	some day commit something without Internet and the project not making it
	through.
