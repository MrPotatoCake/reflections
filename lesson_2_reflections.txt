Q:	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:	It puts a git repository into the directory you initialized. You need to do it because it is the only way 
	to make a git repository?

Q:	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
 	it offers?
A:	The staging area is an intermediate space in between the working directory and the repository. Before you
	make a commit, all files you want in the commit go in there so they can be seperated from other files that
	potentially may belong in a different commit. I think it is very useful because someone could make 10 files in the same program session with very few being related to each other and will likely need a way to seperate them.

Q:	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A:  You can group together edits on multiple files on the same commit so you don't have, for example, 3
	commits which are both edits to 3 files which are closley related and have similar edits instead of just
	1.
